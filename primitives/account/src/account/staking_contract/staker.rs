///                        (a) the resulting non-retired funds respect the invariant 1 - minimum stake for non-retired funds.
/// 3. SetActiveStake:   Re-balances between active and inactive stake by setting the amount of active stake.

///                        (b) the inactive funds are released (*).

///                      The retired balance can always be withdrawn as long as it removes all retired stake.

///             (invariant 3) Inactivation block height is always associated with some inactive balance:
